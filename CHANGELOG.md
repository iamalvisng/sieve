## [0.1.0] - unreleased

First public release.

### Added

- The index. Sieve reads a repo into a symbol graph with call edges.
- The queries: `ask`, `grep`, `callers`, `blast`, `map`, `skeleton` and `why`.
- `sieve why` and its decision anchors. An anchor links a recorded rule or
  reason to the code it covers.
- The read intercept. Sieve answers a read from the graph.
  Sieve does not narrow a read that names `offset` or `limit`.
- Remembered reads. Sieve denies every second read of an unchanged file.
  The read after a deny passes.
- Exact cross-file links for named relative imports in TypeScript and JavaScript.
- The Claude Code pane with 6 mascots and a 3-line status line.
  The look uses Tokyo Night colors.
- The graph viewer.
- The MCP server.
- `sieve stats`. It reports tokens saved for the session, the day and 7 days.
  Use `--json` for machine output.
- A local-only design. Sieve sends no telemetry.
